# GraphEpimodels.jl
Fast, extensible Julia library for simulating epidemic processes on graphs. Implements the Zombie Infection Model (ZIM), SIR model, and provides optimized algorithms for large-scale stochastic simulations. Features exact Gillespie scheduling, specialized lattice implementations, and tools for phase transition analysis.
